# Open Governance Work Brief 

## V2 update for Intro to Computing with micro:bit static resources
The Arm School Program is looking to build on the success of the Intro to Computing with micro:bit (lessons 1-6) by updating the lessons and associated resources to include V2 functionality.
 The resources currently start from the absolute fundamentals up to KS3/Grade7. We require the lessons and associated resources be updated to include:
- V2 functionality where appropriate
- All images of MakeCode and the micro:bit to be updated to the latest version
- Instructions across all docs to be updated to reflect any changes
- Solutions provided as .HEX files

For each lesson the resources consist of:
- A lesson plan
- A slide deck
- Worksheet(s)

## Payment:
£TBC – price per lesson

## Skills and experience required:
- Experience with the V2 micro:bit, new hardware features and application features in MakeCode 
- Experience developing educational content at K-12
- Experience of teaching using Physical Computing and Project Based Learning
- Must have delivered a lesson using a project from the Intro to Computing course or micro:course
- Familiarity with Github
- Awareness of the ASP Open Governance workflow
- Familiarity with the Global Goals (https://www.globalgoals.org/ )
- Knowledge of the Arm School Programs schema and conception of PBL
- Must have completed the ASP EdX course ‘Teaching with Physical Computing’
- Good written skills and a keen eye for detail
- Ability to ideate learning experiences with engaging contexts suitable for micro:bit PBL projects at K-12

## Brief:
- Update all teaching and learning material in a lesson (1-6) to include
  - V2 functionality where appropriate
  - All images of MakeCode and the micro:bit to be updated to the latest version
  - Instructions across all docs to be updated to reflect any changes
  - Solutions provided as .HEX files
- Lessons must use the ASP templates and Schema as provided
- Contexts must be aligned to the Global Goals
- New tasks need to be engaging and solving a ‘real’ problem using a micro:bit linked to context
- The author should indicate and justify where the additions should appear in the resources with a brief explanation (as notes/comments)
- All images need to be copyright free and of sufficient quality and resolution
- .HEX files files need to be provided for each lesson
- Lessons should be of a similar length to the current lessons in the course

## Hardware and software required:
- A micro:bit V2
- USB cable
- Battery pack
- Other peripherals may be required
- Making materials – dependant on project
- Access to MakeCode - https://makecode.microbit.org/ 
- Access to the micro:bit MicroPython IDE: https://python.microbit.org/v/2
